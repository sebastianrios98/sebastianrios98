# 👋 Hi there, I'm Sebastian Rios

---

Welcome to my GitHub profile, I dive deep into:

* 🧬 **Kernel Development & Operating System Internals**
* 🚀 **Linux Performance Optimization and System Tuning**
* 🧰 **Bare-metal Configuration, KVM/QEMU Virtualization, and Networking**
* 🛠️ **Hardware Profiling, Drivers, and Custom Builds**
* 💻 **Terminal-first Workflow with Arch Linux**
* 🌐 **Low-Level Networking and Protocol Analysis**

I specialize in low-level, performance-critical tasks and enjoy solving hard problems that live close to the hardware. Whether it’s tuning sysctl parameters, working on kernel modules, or benchmarking network throughput with minimal overhead, I’m always looking for the most efficient and elegant solution.

### 🧽 Philosophy

I believe in full control over the stack — from bootloader to kernel, from init system to shell. Minimalism, clarity, and precision are my guiding principles.

### 📂 Projects & Contributions

Stay tuned — I’m actively working on:

* 🔧 Custom Linux kernel-based virtual machines
* ⚙️ Processor threads and memory mapping, to ensure optimum, bare-metal like performance.
* 💾 Diverse disk image back-ups (VHD, VHDX, RAW, etc.) support for comprehensive system tuning and scenario testing.
* 📆 Scripts and utilities for Arch Linux
